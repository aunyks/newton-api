# newton
## A really micro micro-service for advanced math.
Newton does anything from numerical calculation to symbolic math parsing.

### How does it work?
1. Send a GET request to newton with a url-encoded math expression and your preferred operation.
2. Get back a JSON response with your problem solved.


### Show me
Let's find the derivative of x^2.
So, we send a request to the newton url saying just that:

-> `https://newton.now.sh/api/v2/derive/x%5E2` (Note the url-encoded `^`)

Now, we get the following response:
```
{
  "operation":"derive",
  "expression":"x^2",
  "result":"2 x"
}
```
It's that simple!

### Get Started
1. Send a GET request to newton.
```
https://newton.now.sh/api/v2/:operation/:expression
```
Note: `:operation` is the math operation that you want to perform. `:expression` is the *url-encoded* math expression on which you want to operate. **View available operation endpoints below!**

2. That's it! You'll be returned a JSON object with the operation you requested, the expression you provided, and the result of the operation performed on the expression.

| Inverse Tangent    | /arctan/0            | 0                 |
| Absolute Value    | /abs/-1            | 1                 |  
| Logarithm | /log/2|8           | 3               |

*Keep in mind:*
To find the tangent line of a function at a certain x value,
send the request as c|f(x) where c is the given x value and f(x) is the function expression, the separator is a vertical bar '|'. See the table above for an example request.

To find the area under a function, send the request as c:d|f(x) where c is the starting x value, d is the ending x value, and f(x) is the function under which you want the curve between the two x values.  

To compute fractions, enter expressions as numerator(over)denominator. For example, to process 2/4 you must send in your expression as 2(over)4. The result expression will be in standard math notation (1/2, 3/4).
